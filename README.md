
Python code for the submitted manuscript entitled **"An Offline Data-driven Dual-surrogate Framework Considering Prediction Error for History Matching"** in *Computers & Geosciences*

## Code
We provide the surrogate model architectures of the manuscript, and please run the **main.py** to test the results using the dual-surrogate model.

**Dual_surrogate.py** file includes the model architecture and training process of the dual-surrogate.

**process.py** file includes the process of the input and output data.

**resnet.py** file includes the residual block v1 and v2. 

We use randomly generated data for the verification of the proposed method. The dataset is large, so we do not upload it to this repository. Data are made available on request. 

## Package
- Python: 3.8.8
- Tensorflow: 2.5.0
